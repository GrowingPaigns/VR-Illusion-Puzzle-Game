# Illusion-based VR Puzzle Game

> _This repository holds my attempt at a VR puzzle adventure that utilizes the forced perspective illusion from the game [Superliminal (2020)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1049410/Superliminal/). I created this in Fall, 2021 as a final project for an Intro to VR/AR design class at the University of Colorado Denver_

### Stretching the bounds of VR:

The creation of VR and the progressive development we have seen since its inception has been nothing short of incredible. I remember putting on my own headset for the first time, and becoming completely engrossed in what I was being shown, despite it being a tutorial on how to operate the device. Each game was a new experience, bending time in Superhot, being terrified as something stalks you down the corridors of Dreadhalls, it was like being transported to a new world. However, eventually even awe-inspiring inventions like this begin to lose their novelty. 

Eventually, after enough use, I found myself becoming less and less immersed in the games I was playing. This once magical portal began to feel like what it was, a computer screen. This is why I initially wanted to work on this project, even though it was by and far too tall an order for an introductory VR student to undertake who had never used Unity before. I wanted to bring that magic back to VR in a way that I didn't see anyone else doing; I wanted to try and see how far I could push the boundaries of a VR game.

So, I decided to recreate the introductory mechanic from the game _Superliminal_, which itself was a game that brought new life and originality to the industry through the use of illusions. It's fun to try and explain this illusion and the way it works, especially face-to-face with someone, as you typically get a range of different confused looks. So instead of trying to explain the illusion, let me present to you this demo video I created for my course:

That video contains my initial attempt at this project from the school semester of Fall 2021. The images below show off an overview of the different areas; this level design was horribly implemented/optimized as can be seen in the nearly 8 gb Unity file which you can find under the folder (VR Illusion Project - 2021 Attempt). Since this point, honestly, not a lot has been done to the game. I did a little bug fixing on the mechanics, but the main updates have been to the level. I have recreated the level multiple different times using multiple different methods since 2021, and I feel I have now (2022) found the best way to implement levels in a 3D space. Eventually, this repository will be updated with another folder containing an updated level, refined mechanics, and new additions not seen in the above video. When will that happen? I don't know. 

Currently (2022), I'm focused on finishing University with good grades and a solid understanding of CS so that I can enter into a career upon graduation. 

### 2023 Update:

I have graduated, and I am currently involved in an internship at a wonderful indie game-dev studio. I am working on a 2D rogue-like platformer with a friend, and I still do not know when this repo will be updated with a better version of the code. Mostly because I still haven't really refined it since my 2022 level updates. I do plan to eventually come back to this project though, as I was truly enjoying developing it. Hopefully the experience I have gained since the 2022 updates will make it an even better game.
